						<h2>Research</h2>

						<p class="normal">Financials and future planning are topics rife with personal pitfalls and social taboos. Therefore, asking in-depth questions about feelings, hopes, and fears was important to us. A simple survey would not have addressed deeper and more personal motivations the way a one-on-one conversation could. Hence, we decided to make use of complimentary methods to research the needs and motivations of our users.</p>


						
						<h3>INTERVIEWS & DRAW THE EXPERIENCE</h3>

						<p class="normal">We conducted in-person interviews with 7 participants and also included a drawing exercise early in the interview. The drawing exercise was a means of having users articulate their current financial landscape, future retirement goals, and expected action path succintly. These drawings became helpful, compact maps of each user’s <i>“financial life plan”</i> and provided additional context and language for the conversation. </p>

						<h3>SECONDARY RESEARCH & COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h3>

						<p class="normal">Secondary research provided valuable insights into our target users and informed our other research methods as well. Since we had only a limited amount of time to conduct research, these insights proved helpful in identifying anomalies or unexpected trends in our findings. Competitor analysis was helpful in understanding what has already been tried, what works, and how our competitors are leveraging people's motivations and desires.</p>

							<h3>QUESTIONNAIRES</h3>

							<p class="normal">The survey provided general trends about retirement planning and gaming habits among our target user group. While not an exhaustive user research method, surveying contributed quantitative results that helped support and provide context for the more comprehensive data collected during interviewing and draw the experience exercises.</p>

							<h2>PROTOTYPING</h2>

							<p class="normal">The next step was to prototype and evaluate our ideas. Given the strict time constraints, we chose to go forward with our favorite of the three ideas generated during the ideation process - Future Self.</p>

							<h3>PAPER PROTOTYPE</h3>
							<p class="normal">To quickly validate our idea, we built a low-fidelity paper prototype and conducted an informal round of testing with users. We also had peer review sessions with other teams from our program. Our participants liked the concept of a conversational style interface, the tone and the language used by the application. We also received important feedback and suggestions to improve some aspects of the design and interactions.</p>

								<!-- <div class="image-caption">Paper Prototypes for Future Self</div> -->
							</div>

							<h3>PROCESS FLOW</h3>
							<p class="normal">
								Our informal tests with the paper prototype revealed some areas where the interactions were confusing for users. Also, we felt that the onboarding process was too long and could be simplified further. Using process flow diagrams, we were able to understand and simplify these interactions reducing the onboarding time by a large extent.

							<h3>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h3>

							<p class="normal">For the High Fidelity Prototype, we used an online prototyping tool called UXPin. Below are some visual designs from the prototype. </p>

							<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

							<p class="normal">
								I really enjoyed working on this project. I learned a great deal about design thinking and the importance of following a user-centered process. Some of the important takeaways are
								<ul>
									<li>Every assumption about the user and the problem should be tested using research.</li>
									<li>Sketches and paper prototypes are inexpensive ways to communicate ideas and receive feedback early in the design process.</li>
									<li>Personas can enable the team to focus, prioritize decisions and design for the right set of users.</li>
									<li>Testing early and often saves a lot of time and keeps the team on the right track.</li>
									<li>Working with a team of individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives boosted our creativity and we were able to generate many clever and innovative ideas.
