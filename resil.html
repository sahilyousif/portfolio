						<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

						<p class="normal">
							Resil is one of Asia’s largest chemical manufacturing companies with presence across 4 continents among varied industries such as Textiles, Agriculture, Pharmaceuticals, etc. 
						</p>

						<p class="normal">
							In April 2014, Resil launched their first consumer facing product in the Indian FMCG market called ‘Klenza’, a non-alcoholic hand sanitizer. A Point-of-Sale promotional strategy was adopted for marketing this product. Promoters were hired to approach customers in retail stores and pharmacies across Bangalore. The promoter’s role was to educate customers about the product, offer free product trials and drive sales. Promoters were also to collect valuable feedback from the customer on feedback forms. This data was used to gather insights from the market and optimize the marketing strategy of the product.

						<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

						<p class="normal">
							The promotional strategy adopted by Resil was inefficient for a number of reasons
							<ul>
								<li>Majority of the promoters lacked good communication skills. They were usually teenagers studying in colleges and hired on a part-time basis. This negatively impacted Resil’s efforts to educate the customer about the product.</li>
								<li>With no system in place to monitor promoter’s activities, many were likely to skip days, check-in late and check-out early. We also witnessed some promoters forging customer feedback forms.</li>
								<li>Promoter attrition rate was high. Recruiting and training new promoters was expensive.</li>
								<li>Feedback forms were collected and digitized on a weekly basis. This data was presented to the marketing team for analysis at the end of a week. This impacted their reaction time delaying strategic decisions, resulting in an inefficient campaign.</li>

							</ul>
							As a result, the sales conversion for Klenza was extremely low. The marketing budget was limited and they could not afford hiring better quality promoters.

						<h2>MY ROLE</h2>

						<p class="normal"> We were a small team of 3 engineers sharing equal responsibilities for the project. We divided the job equally amongst each other and contributed on every aspect of the project - research, design and implementation.

						</p>
						<p class="normal">
							As a researcher, I engaged with stakeholders to study and analyze the problems in the promotional strategy of the product. I also conducted User Interviews and Field Research to understand some of the underlying issues with the existing methods. As a designer, I created several mock-ups and prototypes of the solution. And finally, as a full-stack engineer, I worked on both front-end and back-end technologies to build mobile applications and campaign management tools for Klenza.

						<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

						<p class="normal">
							This showreel is a compilation of all the animation projects we worked on using our in-house motion capture technology. All assets in this video were created by an in-house team of artists and 3D designers.
							
						</p>

					

						
						<p class="normal">
							We used the video in our client meetings and presentations to showcase our capabilities and discuss opportunities for collaboration.

						<h2>RESULTS</h2>

						<p class="normal">
							<ul>
								<li>Customer engagement time for each promoter increased by up to 3x. Customers were more likely to engage with the promoter during tablet-based promotions than otherwise.
								</li>
								<li>Sales conversion ratio increased from baselined 7% to 25% in first month.
								</li>
								<li>The marketing team is now able to take quick data-driven decisions to optimize their promotional strategy. The real-timeness of the data has allowed the reaction time to reduce from 1 week to a few seconds.
								</li>
								<li>Promoters check-in at store on time and are regular. There have been no new cases of false/misrepresented data.
								</li>
							</ul>
